    <p>Welcome!</p>
    <p>This page is decided to pictures of all types of dogs.
       It can be a big dog or a small dog, I don't mind.
    </p>
    <p>Any breeds of dogs are accepted. Actually, you can add your OWN dog here!</p>
    <p>Tell me the type of dog you have, and color, and I'll find a picture of that type of dog.
       Or, if you want me to add a picture of YOUR dog, then email me at:
       example@email.com, and send me the picture. Also tell me what you want to be referred to as in both of these options,
       since I'm going to put either: "recommend by: " or "submitted by: " under the image.
    </p>
    <p>So I hope you enjoy the website!</p>
